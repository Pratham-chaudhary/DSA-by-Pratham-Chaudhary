# Finding Minimum and Maximum in an Array

This Java program demonstrates how to find the minimum and maximum elements in an array of integers.

## Instructions

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Compile the `Main.java` file using the following command:
    ```bash
    javac Main.java
    ```
3. Run the compiled Java program using the following command:
    ```bash
    java Main
    ```

## Code Explanation

The `Main.java` file contains a Java class named `Main`, which has a `main` method that initializes an array of integers and calls the `minmax` method.

The `minmax` method takes an array of integers as input and iterates through the array to find the minimum and maximum elements. It then prints out the minimum and maximum values.

## Example

Suppose we have the following array of integers:
```java
int arr[] = {2, 6, 3, 8, 1, 56, 10, 46, 52, 5};
